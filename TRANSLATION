00:06:18 {Misato}      Don't let go of the target object, even if it means sacrificing the unit.

00:13:08 {Midori}      Confirming the target's pillar of light.
00:13:10 {Midori}      Its... numbers are increasing somehow!
00:13:13 {Aoba}        We can't grasp the target's core block.
00:13:15 {Aoba}        It is probably being concealed on the outside of a phased cocoon.
00:13:18 {Ritsuko}     This is bad.
00:13:20 {Ritsuko}     At this rate, we'll be on the receiving end of a saturation bombing.
00:13:22 {Midori}      600 seconds until contact.
00:13:24 {Ritsuko}     Captain Katsuragi,
00:13:25 {Ritsuko}     I propose an immediate dispersal of the fleets.
00:13:29 {Ritsuko}     We have insufficient crew and limited resources.
00:13:32 {Ritsuko}     Compounding the problem, this main ship's camouflage equipment is incomplete.
00:13:34 {Ritsuko}     On top of that, we cannot grasp the target's core block.
00:13:38 {Ritsuko}     In other words, our chance of winning is zero.
00:13:41 {Ritsuko}     At this point, we should retreat like we usually do. 
00:13:43 {Ritsuko}     There is no way.
00:13:45 {Ritsuko}     Captain Katsuragi!
00:13:47 {Misato}      This is why I will change the current situation to neutralize any possibly anxiety.
00:13:52 {Misato}      Vice Captain, we're going to fly.
00:13:54 {Ritsuko}     Fly?! 
00:13:55 {Ritsuko}     You can't be thinking of using the main ship?
00:13:57 {Misato}      All hands, prepare for launch! 
00:14:00 {Misato}      Prepare for ignition of the main engines!
00:14:03 {Ritsuko}     It's too reckless to use the main ship all of a sudden, Captain Katsuragi!
00:14:06 {Tama}        I agree! 
00:14:07 {Tama}        We haven't even run a test flight. It's too dangerous.
00:14:09 {Sumire}      Anti-gravity also hasn't been tested. 
00:14:11 {Sumire}      I don't have confidence in it.
00:14:13 {Midori}      I don't want to fight battles that can't be won. 
00:14:15 {Midori}      I don't want to die just yet.
00:14:17 {Koji}        You die when you die. That's all there is to it. 
00:14:19 {Koji}        Quit complaining, younglings.
00:14:21 {Midori}      Wah... Elders should be more careful!
00:14:25 {Misato}      I am aware of the recklessness. 
00:14:27 {Misato}      We will use this ship as decoy and fish it out to the surface!
00:14:30 {Misato}      The power to kill gods. I will see it through to the end.
00:14:33 {Ritsuko}     But the most important ignition system has not been installed. 
00:14:36 {Ritsuko}     Don't tell me you're going to use the Evas?
00:14:39 {Misato}      Mari!
00:14:40 {Mari}        Eva-08 isn't ready yet.

00:14:42 {Shinji}      ...Asuka?
00:14:46 {Asuka}       I'm already on it! 
00:14:47 {Asuka}       I just have to shove the ignition engine in, right?
00:14:50 {Misato}      I'm counting on you.
00:14:51 {Ritsuko}     But there is a problem with the barrier density around the ship. 
00:14:54 {Ritsuko}     Plus, isn't there work being done on the bridge?
00:14:56 {Asuka}       Well, "prioritize the objective, human life expendable" is a captain's motto, after all.

00:16:20 {Shinji}      You don't need me to pilot Eva-01? 
00:16:23 {Shinji}      Misato-san?!
00:16:26 {Ritsuko}     That's correct. 
00:16:27 {Ritsuko}     There's no need for you to pilot the Eva.

00:24:09 {Koji}        How totally reckless. 
00:24:12 {Koji}        Well, she's an even more interesting captain than Kaji said.
00:24:15 {Ritsuko}     So this is the power to kill gods. 
00:24:17 {Ritsuko}     Wunder really is the ship of hope.
00:25:00 {Sakura}      Specimen DM03, Tentative Name Ikari Shinji-san... 
00:25:03 {Sakura}      The executive officer will have a word with you.
00:25:06 {Shinji}      This is Eva-01...?
00:25:08 {Ritsuko}     Yes. Eva-01 is being used as the main engine of this ship. 
00:25:13 {Ritsuko}     Consequently, you serve no use as a pilot. 
00:25:16 {Shinji}      Ah, so I really am not needed. 
00:25:19 {Ritsuko}     Also, your sync test results have come back. 
00:25:23 {Ritsuko}     The sync rate is 0.00%.
00:25:26 {Ritsuko}     Even if you were to get in the Eva, it wouldn't activate.
00:25:30 {Sakura}      Really?
00:25:31 {Sakura}      Isn't that great news, Ikari-san? 
00:25:33 {Ritsuko}     Even so, we cannot overlook the fact that, earlier, Eva-01 suddenly entered an Awakened state for 12 seconds.
00:25:39 {Ritsuko}     As a result, the DSS Choker has been installed on you.
00:25:44 {Shinji}      What is this?
00:25:45 {Ritsuko}     Safety for us. 
00:25:48 {Ritsuko}     It's a physical safety device to circumvent Awakenings. 
00:25:51 {Ritsuko}     And it is also a symbol of your punishment.
00:25:55 {Shinji}      What does it do?
00:25:56 {Ritsuko}     If you lose control of your emotions while piloting an Eva and become unable to suppress the risk of Awakening,
00:26:04 {Ritsuko}     this will intervene by terminating your life.
00:26:08 {Shinji}      Does that mean... I will die?
00:26:13 {Ritsuko}     I will not deny that.
00:26:16 {Shinji}      No way...
00:26:18 {Shinji}      Misato-san, what is all this about dying?
00:26:22 {Shinji}      This is weird, Misato-san! 
00:26:24 {Shinji}      Suddenly it's all so confusing, and I don't understand anything!
00:26:27 {Ritsuko}     It can't be helped that you're confused.
00:26:28 {Ritsuko}     Second Lieutenant!
00:26:29 {Sakura}      Yes, ma'am!
00:26:30 {Ritsuko}     Introduce yourself.
00:26:31 {Sakura}      Yes, ma'am!
00:26:33 {Sakura}      Um, it's late, but I'm the medical officer in charge,
00:26:38 {Sakura}      2nd Lt. Suzuhara Sakura.
00:26:41 {Sakura}      Nice to meet you.
00:26:43 {Shinji}      Ah, s-same.
00:26:46 {Shinji}      But, "Suzuhara"...
00:26:48 {Shinji}      Are you Toji's...?
00:26:50 {Sakura}      Ah, yes.
00:26:51 {Sakura}      I owe everything to my big brother. 
00:26:53 {Sakura}      I'm his little sister Sakura.
00:26:55 {Shinji}      Little sister?
00:26:56 {Shinji}      Don't you mean big sister?
00:26:57 {Sakura}      No, little sister.
00:27:01 {Shinji}      Little sister...? How?
00:27:04 {Asuka}       Fourteen years have passed since then. 
00:27:07 {Asuka}       Stupid Shinji.
00:27:09 {Shinji}      Huh? Ah, Asuka!
00:27:15 {Shinji}      Thank god. 
00:27:16 {Shinji}      You really are safe, Asuka!
00:27:23 {Asuka}       I can't stand this. 
00:27:25 {Asuka}       I've been holding this in.
00:27:34 {Shinji}      What was that all about...?
00:27:36 {Asuka}       Built up anger and grief.
00:27:39 {Shinji}      What do you mean...? 
00:27:41 {Shinji}      Uh, Asuka, your left eye...
00:27:44 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:27:46 {Shinji}      Asuka, you said it's been fourteen years,
00:27:49 {Shinji}      but the only thing that's changed about you is that eyepatch.
00:27:52 {Asuka}       Right. It's the Curse of Eva.
00:27:55 {Shinji}      A curse?
00:27:59 {Shinji}      Wait! 
00:28:00 {Shinji}      Asuka, maybe you know! 
00:28:02 {Shinji}      Where's Ayanami?!
00:28:05 {Asuka}       Dunno.
00:28:06 {Shinji}      You don't know...? 
00:28:08 {Shinji}      But I saved her!
00:28:10 {Asuka}       All this fuss over just one person.
00:28:12 {Asuka}       This world doesn't have time to cater to your ego.
00:28:16 {Asuka}       Isn't that right, Captain Katsuragi?
00:28:22 {Shinji}      Asuka!
00:28:23 {Shinji}      Misato-san, where's Ayanami?! 
00:28:26 {Shinji}      You've got to tell me!
00:28:27 {Misato}      Shinji-kun, Ayanami Rei no longer exists.
00:28:31 {Shinji}      No, I saved her, I know I did.
00:28:34 {Shinji}      She must still be in Eva-01's plug.
00:28:37 {Shinji}      Please, search for her!
00:28:38 {Ritsuko}     We've already conducted a thorough sweep of Eva-01.
00:28:42 {Ritsuko}     We only found you.
00:28:45 {Ritsuko}     And for some reason, this was restored.
00:28:48 {Ritsuko}     The inspection yielded no problems. We'll return it.
00:28:52 {Shinji}      My father's...。
00:28:55 {Shinji}      Ayanami was holding it then.
00:28:58 {Shinji}      So I saved her, didn't I?
00:29:01 {Shinji}      What?!
00:29:04 {Misato}      It's me.
00:29:06 {Hyuga (Phone)} Target is on the rear deck! 
00:29:07 {Hyuga (Phone)} It suddenly closed in on us!
00:29:09 {Misato}      So the champion is on the scene... 
00:29:10 {Misato}      All fleets to Primary Battle Stations. 
00:29:12 {Misato}      Safeguarding Eva-01 is top priority!
00:29:14 {Asuka}       Eva-08, you're ready to go, right?
00:29:16 {Mari}        But of course.
00:29:18 {Mari}        I'm right on top of it, Princess. 
00:29:19 {Mari}        By the way, how was Puppy Boy?
00:29:22 {Mari}        Is he obediently staying put?
00:29:24 {Asuka (Phone)} Nothing's changed about his stupid lowly face.
00:29:28 {Mari}        Oh, so you went to go see his face, did you?
00:29:31 {Asuka (Phone)} No! 
00:29:32 {Asuka (Phone)} It was awful. I hit him.
00:29:34 {Asuka}       I feel much better now.
00:29:35 {Shinji}      Misato-san, Ritsuko-san! 
00:29:37 {Shinji}      Just who is coming?
00:29:39 {Shinji}      Is it a new Angel?!
00:29:41 {Rei}         Ikari-kun, where are you?
00:29:44 {Shinji}      Ayanami?
00:29:46 {Shinji}      That was Ayanami's voice just now, wasn't it!?
00:29:49 {Shinji}      Misa-
00:29:53 {Shinji}      What is going on here!?
00:29:55 {Sakura}      Preparations complete! 
00:29:56 {Sakura}      Ikari-san, this way!
00:29:58 {Rei}         Ikari-kun, where are you?
00:30:01 {Shinji}      It really is Ayanami.
00:30:04 {Shinji}      It's Ayanami!
00:30:06 {Sakura}      Ikari-san! Quickly!
00:30:11 {Shinji}      Enough.
00:30:13 {Shinji}      Ayanami, I'm right here!
00:30:28 {Shinji}      Eva... Unit 00.
00:30:30 {Rei}         Ikari-kun... 
00:30:32 {Rei}         Come this way.
00:30:35 {Misato}      Don't do it, Shinji-kun.
00:30:37 {Misato}      Just stay right here.
00:30:38 {Shinji}      What's with that, Misato-san?
00:30:41 {Shinji}      Weren't you just saying a moment ago that you didn't need me?
00:30:43 {Misato}      Even so, you'll be kept in our custody.
00:30:45 {Shinji}      That's just too one-sided!
00:30:53 {Shinji}      Please stop it! 
00:50:53 {Shinji}      The target is an Eva!
00:30:55 {Misato}      That's why.
00:30:57 {Misato}      We will eradicate all of Nerv's Evas.
00:30:59 {Shinji}      Nerv... 
00:31:01 {Shinji}      This isn't Nerv, too?
00:31:02 {Misato}      We are Wille, an organization dedicated to Nerv's destruction.
00:31:07 {Shinji}      That's... 
00:31:09 {Shinji}      No, but it's being piloted by Ayanami!
00:31:12 {Misato}      It's not her! 
00:31:13 {Misato}      Rei is gone, Shinji-kun.
00:31:15 {Shinji}      Liar! 
00:31:16 {Shinji}      I mean, she's right here, isn't she?!
00:31:18 {Shinji}      You're just daft, Misato-san! 
00:31:20 {Shinji}      I've had enough!
00:31:24 {Sakura}      Ikari-san!
00:31:27 {Sakura}      / Even if you leave, {帰ってもいいですけど、}
00:31:29 {Sakura}      Please just don't pilot an Eva!
00:31:31 {Sakura}      I really do want you to forgive me...
00:31:43 {Asuka}       Glasses, don't let it get away!
00:31:44 {Mari}        Loud and clear!
00:31:48 {Mari}        ♪ When you take aim ♪ 
00:31:50 {Mari}        ♪ Be careful not to miss your mark ♪
00:31:55 {Mari}        Hey, come on!
00:32:02 {Mari}        Alright!
00:32:09 {Mari}        I knew it! An Adams' vessel?
00:32:17 {Mari}        At least say 'hi' or something!
00:32:22 {Ritsuko}     The fact he was taken in priority over Eva-01 
00:32:25 {Ritsuko}     means he still has potential as a trigger!
00:32:27 {Ritsuko}     Misato! Use the DSS choker!
00:32:44 {Ritsuko}     Mission directive from Executive Officer. 
00:32:46 {Ritsuko}     Pursuit unnecessary. 
00:32:47 {Ritsuko}     All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operations.
00:32:51 {Man}         Roger. 
00:32:52 {Man}         Pursuit unnecessary. 
00:32:53 {Asuka}       Hmph.
00:32:54 {Man}         All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operation.
00:32:55 {Asuka}       What do you know. 
00:32:56 {Asuka}       He's not an idiot, just a brat!
00:33:16 {Shinji}      I did save her after all. 
00:33:18 {Shinji}      Misato-san is a liar.
00:33:21 {Rei}         This way.
00:33:31 {Shinji}      Um...
00:33:48 {Shinji}      Even though this is the Geofront, you can see the sky.
00:34:00 {Shinji}      Is that... Nerv Headquarters? 
00:34:04 {Shinji}      What happened?
00:34:36 {Shinji}      It really has been fourteen years.
00:35:15 {Rei}         Here.
00:35:19 {Shinji}      What's this? 
00:35:22 {Shinji}      An Eva...?
00:35:23 {Gendo}       That's right.
00:35:28 {Shinji}      Father...
00:35:30 {Gendo}       Evangelion 13.
00:35:32 {Gendo}       A unit for you and that pilot.
00:35:37 {Shinji}      The one on the piano earlier?
00:35:40 {Gendo}       When the time comes, pilot this Eva along with the boy. 
00:35:45 {Gendo}       We are done talking.
00:35:48 {Shinji}      Wait a second, Father! 
00:35:49 {Shinji}      I still have a lot of questions, a lot I want to talk about! 
00:35:53 {Shinji}      Father!
00:36:04 {Shinji}      There's no dial tone, 
00:36:06 {Shinji}      so I can't reach anyone from here.
00:36:29 {Shinji}      /I really should get going. {やっぱり、お礼言っとかなきゃ。}
00:36:42 {Shinji}      Ayanami!
00:36:46 {Shinji}      Ayanami, where are you?
00:36:50 {Shinji}      Ayanami!
00:37:26 {Shinji}      That's weird, this place is... 
00:37:30 {Shinji}      Ayanami?!
00:37:31 {Shinji}      There you are!
00:37:35 {Shinji}      Ayanami!
00:37:36 {Shinji}      I've been looking for you！
00:37:37 {Shinji}      Um. Ah, wait!
00:37:40 {Shinji}      Clothes! Put some clothes on!
00:37:44 {Rei}         If that is an order, I will do it.
00:37:48 {Shinji}      I'm coming in...
00:37:53 {Shinji}      Um, Ayanami, thank you for this. 
00:57:59 {Shinji}      I've been wanting to thank you for a while.
00:38:09 {Shinji}      Your plugsuit got renewed. 
00:38:12 {Shinji}      It suits you. Though black is a little...
00:38:21 {Shinji}      Nerv HQ has changed quite a lot, hasn't it?
00:38:28 {Shinji}      Why is Misato-san fighting against Nerv and not the Angels?
00:38:33 {Shinji}      What does father intend to do here? 
00:38:36 {Shinji}      What's happened to everyone?
00:38:38 {Shinji}      Hey, Ayanami, do you know anything?
00:38:42 {Rei}         I do not.
00:38:43 {Shinji}      I see... 
00:38:46 {Shinji}      /うん、そうかもな。
00:38:49 {Shinji}      Say, when did you return from Eva-01?
00:38:59 {Shinji}      This place isn't much of a room.
00:39:03 {Shinji}      You could say it's just your style, 
00:39:06 {Shinji}      but it doesn't seem like there is school, so what do you do all the time?
00:39:10 {Rei}         Wait. For orders.
00:39:15 {Shinji}      There are no books here. 
00:39:17 {Shinji}      You're not reading any books?
00:39:19 {Rei}         Books?
00:39:21 {Rei}         If I were Ayanami Rei, would I read books?
00:39:24 {Shinji}      Yeah. You read a lot, didn't you?
00:39:27 {Shinji}      There were books in your room, too.
00:39:29 {Rei}         I see...
00:39:30 {Shinji}      I got it!
00:39:31 {Shinji}      I'll go look in the library here and bring you some.
00:39:34 {Shinji}      Um, English books are good, right? 
00:39:37 {Shinji}      You always had one on you, so I guess you liked them.
00:39:40 {Rei}         "Liked"...?
00:39:41 {Shinji}      Yeah... At least, I think so.
00:39:44 {Rei}         What is "liked"?
00:39:56 {Fuyutsuki}   So Seele are still maintaining their silence?
00:40:00 {Gendo}       The Human Instrumentality Project will be carried out according to the Dead Sea Scrolls.
00:40:05 {Gendo}       We no longer need to weave the story.
00:40:09 {Fuyutsuki}   Ikari, you intend to use Eva-13 this time?
00:40:15 {Fuyutsuki}   No matter. I will go along with your plan.
00:40:21 {Fuyutsuki}   For Yui-kun's sake.
00:40:25 {Shinji}      It's no use. It doesn't work. 
00:40:35 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:40:36 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:40:38 {Sakura}      Please, just don't pilot an Eva!
00:40:40 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:40:41 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:41:37 {Kaworu}      Come down here, Ikari-kun. 
00:41:39 {Kaworu}      Let's talk!
00:41:46 {Shinji}      U-Uh, aren't we going to talk?
00:41:49 {Kaworu}      A piano duet is a dialogue of sounds, you could say. 
00:41:52 {Kaworu}      Why don't we try it?
00:41:56 {Shinji}      No, that's alright. I can't play.
00:41:58 {Kaworu}      If you want to live well, you have to change and try new things.
00:42:08 {Kaworu}      Look, it's easy. 
00:42:09 {Kaworu}      You just have to hit this key here.
00:42:27 {Kaworu}      Now, follow along with me.
00:42:53 {Kaworu}      Very good! 
00:42:55 {Kaworu}      You're playing so well. 
00:43:32 {Kaworu}      Every note is a joy.
00:43:35 {Kaworu}      We're amazing together, aren't we?
00:43:42 {Shinji}      Thanks. 
00:44:44 {Shinji}      It's been ages since I've had this much fun.
00:43:46 {Kaworu}      Same here. 
00:43:48 {Kaworu}      We'll have to do this again. 
00:43:49 {Kaworu}      You can come anytime, Ikari Shinji-kun.
00:43:52 {Shinji}      Sure. 
00:43:53 {Shinji}      Oh, you are...?
00:43:55 {Kaworu}      I'm Kaworu, Nagisa Kaworu. 
00:43:59 {Kaworu}      I'm a child chosen by fate, the same as you.
00:44:08 {Shinji}      She's not here this time, either. 
00:44:11 {Shinji}      The books haven't been touched, either.
00:44:29 {Kaworu}      Good morning, Ikari Shinji-kun. 
00:44:33 {Kaworu}      You're here early today.
00:44:35 {Shinji}      I don't really have anything else to do.
00:45:07 {Shinji}      I wonder how I could play it better...
00:45:10 {Kaworu}      You don't need to be good at playing it. 
00:45:13 {Kaworu}      Just producing a pleasing sound will suffice.
00:45:17 {Shinji}      So if I want to improve the sound I'm making, what should I do?
00:45:21 {Kaworu}      It takes repeated practice.
00:45:23 {Kaworu}      Doing it over and over until it feels good enough to you.
00:45:30 {Kaworu}      That's the only way.
00:46:02 {Kaworu}      It's okay, leave it to me. 
00:46:03 {Kaworu}      /Just move along. {動くようにすればいいんだね。}
00:46:05 {Shinji}      Hm, thank you. 
00:46:07 {Shinji}      I feel bad for making you do so much for me.
00:46:10 {Kaworu}      You don't need to worry about that. 
00:46:12 {Kaworu}      We're friends, after all.
00:46:18 {Kaworu}      It's gotten quite dark, hasn't it? 
00:46:20 {Kaworu}      Why don't we head back for today?
00:46:23 {Shinji}      Hey, why don't we stay here for a little longer?
00:45:26 {Shinji}      We could watch the stars from here.
00:46:28 {Kaworu}      The stars?
00:46:31 {Kaworu}      Do you like the stars?
00:46:34 {Shinji}      Yeah. 
00:46:36 {Shinji}      It's always struck me how large the universe is.
00:46:39 {Shinji}      There's something about it that's put my mind completely at ease, ever since I was little.
00:46:44 {Shinji}      I guess I'm glad that it hasn't changed at all these past fourteen years. 
00:46:49 {Shinji}      It calms me down, if that makes sense.
00:46:55 {Shinji}      Uh, it's hard to put into words.
00:46:58 {Kaworu}      Your feelings came through.
00:47:01 {Kaworu}      Instead of seeking change, you prefer a world of nothingness and brutal abyss.
00:47:06 {Kaworu}      It's like you.
00:47:09 {Kaworu}      Lying here together is nice.
00:47:12 {Kaworu}      I didn't know it could be so pleasant.
00:47:15 {Kaworu}      Thanks for inviting me.
00:47:18 {Shinji}      No, you don't need to.
00:47:20 {Shinji}      I just thought that it'd be fun, if you wanted to try it, and...
00:47:27 {Kaworu}      It is fun.
00:47:30 {Kaworu}      I really was born to meet you.
00:47:50 {Shinji}      Hm? I wonder if it's still noticeable...
00:47:53 {Shinji}      Huh?
00:48:00 {Kaworu}      Here, it should work now.
00:48:03 {Shinji}      Thanks. 
00:48:04 {Shinji}      You're amazing, Nagisa-kun. 
00:48:06 {Shinji}      You can do everything.
00:48:08 {Kaworu}      This is just knowledge. 
00:48:10 {Kaworu}      It's because I've stayed in this world for a little longer than you.
00:48:14 {Shinji}      Still... you're amazing.
00:48:18 {Kaworu}      You don't look too well. 
00:48:20 {Kaworu}      What's wrong?
00:48:25 {Shinji}      I'm worried about my friends.
00:48:29 {Kaworu}      Friends?
00:48:30 {Shinji}      Yeah. 
00:48:32 {Shinji}      There was a city above Nerv HQ. 
00:48:35 {Shinji}      That's where everyone lived.
00:48:37 {Shinji}      Toji, Kensuke, 
00:48:38 {Shinji}      Prez, the rest of the class...
00:48:41 {Shinji}      Apparently I'd been sleeping in Eva-01 for fourteen years.
00:48:45 {Shinji}      I don't know what's changed in that time.
00:48:50 {Kaworu}      Not knowing the answer to that must be painful.
00:48:54 {Shinji}      Somehow, I'm scared.
00:48:57 {Shinji}      Of what's happened to the city and everybody...
00:49:02 {Shinji}      I'm scared of it for some reason.
00:49:04 {Shinji}      That's right, I'm scared!
00:49:15 {Kaworu}      Do you want to know?
00:49:44 {Shinji}      Nagisa-kun?
00:49:46 {Shinji}      Nagisa-kun!
00:50:03 {Kaworu}      Just a little longer now.
00:50:22 {Kaworu}      The clouds will disperse soon, 
00:50:24 {Kaworu}      And you will see the truth you desire.
00:50:36 {Shinji}      What is this...?
00:50:42 {Kaworu}      The outcome of Third Impact, which came to pass while you were merged with Eva-01.
00:50:51 {Shinji}      But this is... 
00:50:53 {Shinji}      What happened to everyone in the city?
00:50:55 {Kaworu}      Mass extinction is not unusual on this planet.
00:50:58 {Kaworu}      Rather, it is the aspect that drives evolution.
00:51:02 {Kaworu}      Because life is fundamentally something that adjusts to the world and changes itself.
00:51:08 {Kaworu}      However, Lilin do not change themselves, but the world.
00:51:15 {Kaworu}      So they brought the rite of artificial evolution unto themselves.
00:51:21 {Kaworu}      Old life is offered in sacrifice, 
00:51:23 {Kaworu}      so that new beings blessed with the Fruit of Life may be created.
00:51:29 {Kaworu}      All this is due to the death instinct that's been programmed since time immemorial.
00:51:33 {Kaworu}      Nerv call it the Human Instrumentality Project.
00:51:38 {Shinji}      This is Nerv's...
00:51:43 {Shinji}      This is what my father was doing.
00:51:48 {Kaworu}      Ikari Shinji-kun, 
00:51:50 {Kaworu}      once Awakened, Eva-01 opened the Door of Guf 
00:51:55 {Kaworu}      and became the trigger for Third Impact.
00:51:58 {Kaworu}      Lilin call it Near Third Impact. 
00:52:02 {Kaworu}      It was all initiated by you.
00:52:09 {Shinji}      You're wrong! 
00:52:10 {Shinji}      All I did was save Ayanami!
00:52:16 {Kaworu}      True, but that was the catalyst...
00:52:21 {Shinji}      All this... 
00:52:25 {Shinji}      I didn't know! 
00:52:27 {Shinji}      You're telling me all of this so fast, 
00:52:29 {Shinji}      and there's nothing I can do about it!
00:52:30 {Kaworu}      Indeed. 
00:52:31 {Kaworu}      There's nothing you can do about your past.
00:52:35 {Kaworu}      The truth you desired to know.
00:52:38 {Kaworu}      The Lilin are providing you reparation for your sin as a result.
00:52:43 {Kaworu}      That's what your neck device is, no?
00:52:48 {Shinji}      What sin? 
00:52:50 {Shinji}      I didn't do anything!
00:52:52 {Shinji}      I had nothing to do with it!
00:52:54 {Kaworu}      If it wasn't you, then who was it?
00:52:58 {Kaworu}      However, no sin is beyond redemption.
00:53:02 {Kaworu}      There is always hope. 
00:53:04 {Kaworu}      Always.
00:53:23 {Fuyutsuki}   Seele's boy has contacted the Third Boy.
00:53:27 {Fuyutsuki}   He showed him the conditions outside, it seems.
00:53:30 {Fuyutsuki}   Was his reaction as you anticipated?
00:53:33 {Fuyutsuki}   Are you okay with all of this, Ikari?
00:53:35 {Gendo}       Seele's scenario is being rewritten by us.
00:53:39 {Gendo}       All existence is nothing more than a tool to that ends.
00:53:42 {Fuyutsuki}   You assume that your son wouldn't benefit even from seeing how you live?
00:53:48 {Fuyutsuki}   I don't agree with that.
00:53:53 {Shinji}      What is...
00:53:56 {Shinji}      What am I supposed--
00:54:03 {Shinji}      Right... I saved Ayanami.
00:54:06 {Shinji}      Wasn't that the right thing?
00:54:32 {Shinji}      She's gone again. 
00:54:34 {Shinji}      She still hasn't touched the books.
00:54:38 {Shinji}      What's going on...? 
00:54:40 {Shinji}      What's wrong with Ayanami?!
00:54:53 {Fuyutsuki}   Third Boy, do you play shogi?
00:54:57 {Shinji}      Eh... I only sort of know the rules.
00:55:00 {Fuyutsuki}   That's fine. Choose a side.
00:55:03 {Fuyutsuki}   I'll start without a castle, bishop, and golden general.
00:55:12 {Fuyutsuki}   Let your mind be still.
00:55:16 {Fuyutsuki}   It's the only way to achieve victory.
00:55:19 {Fuyutsuki}   You'll lose in another thirty-one turns.
00:55:24 {Fuyutsuki}   Hmm... 
00:55:31 {Fuyutsuki}   Is it more fun for you this way?
00:55:35 {Fuyutsuki}   Thank you for indulging an old man his hobby.
00:55:43 {Fuyutsuki}   I'm a coward too, you know. 
00:55:45 {Fuyutsuki}   I used this game as a pretext to talk to you.
00:55:50 {Fuyutsuki}   Do you remember your mother?
00:55:54 {Shinji}      No. I was too small. 
00:55:58 {Shinji}      Father got rid of everything that was hers.
00:56:07 {Shinji}      Is this... 
00:56:10 {Shinji}      Ayanami?
00:56:13 {Fuyutsuki}   Your mother. 
00:56:14 {Fuyutsuki}   Maiden name, Ayanami Yui.
00:56:16 {Fuyutsuki}   She was my student at the university.
00:56:20 {Fuyutsuki}   Now, she is the control system of Eva Unit 01.
00:56:27 {Fuyutsuki}   Hm. The power was finally restored.
00:56:33 {Fuyutsuki}   The control system from very early in the Evas' development.
00:56:37 {Fuyutsuki}   Here, Yui-kun proposed direct entry into cores,
00:56:41 {Fuyutsuki}   and tested it with herself as the experimentee.
00:56:45 {Fuyutsuki}   You were watching, too. Your memory must have been erased.
00:56:55 {Fuyutsuki}   The result was that Yui-kun vanished here, 
00:56:59 {Fuyutsuki}   and only her data was recovered, in the Ayanami Series.
00:57:03 {Fuyutsuki}   The Rei you know is one of Yui-kun's clones.
00:57:08 {Fuyutsuki}   She is preserved within Eva-01, the same as your mother.
00:57:13 {Fuyutsuki}   All of it is Ikari's plan.
00:57:17 {Shinji}      No way...
00:57:20 {Fuyutsuki}   Breaking the world is not difficult.
00:57:24 {Fuyutsuki}   But rebuilding it, that isn't so easy.
00:57:28 {Fuyutsuki}   The world can be reversed no more than time. 
00:57:32 {Fuyutsuki}   Nor even the human heart...
00:57:35 {Fuyutsuki}   And thus, so that his wish might be granted, 
00:57:38 {Fuyutsuki}   Ikari is paying every price there is.
00:57:41 {Fuyutsuki}   Even his very soul.
00:57:44 {Fuyutsuki}   I've imparted to you a little of the truth. 
00:57:47 {Fuyutsuki}   About your father, as well...
00:58:01 {Fuyutsuki}   I could have been given a more pleasant part to play.
00:58:04 {Fuyutsuki}   Yui-kun, this should do.
00:58:15 {Gendo}       The time of the final contract is upon us.
00:58:20 {Gendo}       Wait just a little longer, Yui.
00:58:31 {Shinji}      Why aren't you reading the books?
00:58:36 {Rei}         That wasn't your order.
00:58:38 {Shinji}      "Order"...?
00:58:40 {Shinji}      Alright, that's enough!
00:58:45 {Shinji}      / Are you still(?) Ayanami...? {まだ（？）、綾波だよね・・・？}
00:58:48 {Rei}         Yes, Ayanami Rei.
00:58:51 {Shinji}      Then I did save you, right...?
00:58:55 {Rei}         ...I don't know.
00:59:04 {Rei}         Ikari-kun...?
00:59:11 {Shinji}      So, I didn't actually save her...
00:59:15 {Shinji}      Ayanami...
00:59:17 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:59:21 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:21 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:23 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:27 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:29 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:59:32 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:33 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:34 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:36 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:39 {Shinji}      Father...
00:59:40 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:41 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:59:42 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:43 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:44 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:45 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:59:46 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:46 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:48 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:59:48 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:49 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:51 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:52 {Misato}      Don't do anything.
00:59:53 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:53 {Asuka}       ...your business.
00:59:54 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:55 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:56 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:59 {Rei}         I don't know.
01:00:00 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
01:00:08 {Shinji}      What did I do?
01:00:47 {Fuyutsuki}   Has the final executor been completed?
01:00:50 {Gendo}       Yes, everything we need is right here.
01:00:56 {Kaworu}      The time has come.
01:00:59 {Kaworu}      This is it, Ikari Shinji-kun.
01:01:02 {Shinji}      No!
01:01:05 {Shinji}      I don't want to pilot an Eva anymore!
01:01:07 {Shinji}      I didn't save Ayanami after all!
01:01:10 {Shinji}      Nothing good came out of me piloting the Eva!
01:01:13 {Shinji}      I've had enough! I don't want to do anything!
01:01:16 {Kaworu}      And so, the refrain of bitter memories will keep good things from happening.
01:01:24 {Shinji}      Nothing is ever good!
01:01:26 {Shinji}      You were the one who showed me that, Kaworu. 
01:01:29 {Shinji}      A world where I can't do anything!
01:01:32 {Kaworu}      That which was changed by Eva can be changed back by Eva in turn.
01:01:37 {Shinji}      You say that, but my father, Eva, Misato-san... 
01:01:39 {Shinji}      I can't believe in anyone, or anything!
01:01:43 {Kaworu}      Still, I want you to believe in me.
01:01:46 {Shinji}      I can't!
01:01:49 {Shinji}      Misato-san put this thing on me!
01:01:53 {Shinji}      They said to never pilot Eva again.
01:01:55 {Shinji}      They said if I pilot, I will die.
01:01:59 {Shinji}      I don't care about Eva anymore.
01:02:09 {Kaworu}      I know.
01:02:10 {Kaworu}      I will shoulder the burden of the Lilin's curse and the risk of Eva's Awakening for you.
01:02:21 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun...
01:02:24 {Kaworu}      You don't have to worry. 
01:02:26 {Kaworu}      Because I was originally something created by the very Lilin who fear me.
01:02:29 {Kaworu}      I had intended to do this at some stage.
01:02:34 {Kaworu}      Ikari Shinji-kun. Your only hope lies with the two Spears left at the Impact epicenter in Dogma.
01:02:41 {Kaworu}      They are the key to activating Instrumentality.
01:02:45 {Kaworu}      All we have to do is obtain those Spears.
01:02:48 {Kaworu}      If we do that, Nerv will not be able to cause Fourth Impact.
01:02:52 {Kaworu}      If we use them together with Eva-13, it becomes possible to fix the world.
01:02:58 {Shinji}      You're right.
01:03:03 {Shinji}      Yes. It is possible for you.
01:03:05 {Kaworu}      It is possible WITH you.
01:03:07 {Kaworu}      Eva-13 uses a double entry system.
01:03:11 {Kaworu}      Let the two of us become the hope of the Lilin.
01:03:15 {Kaworu}      Because the things that you need the most right now are hope,
01:03:19 {Kaworu}      along with atonement and an open heart.
01:03:25 {Shinji}      You're amazing. You know everything.
01:03:30 {Kaworu}      That's because I am always thinking about you.
01:03:35 {Shinji}      Thank you, Nagisa-kun.
01:03:38 {Kaworu}      "Kaworu" is fine.
01:03:40 {Shinji}      Ah, okay. 
01:03:43 {Shinji}      "Shinji" is fine for me, too.
01:03:49 {Kaworu}      It is the same as playing piano. 
01:03:50 {Kaworu}      Good things will come if we do it together.
01:03:56 {Shinji}      Let's go, Kaworu-kun.
01:04:38 {Both}        Evangelion 13, start up!
01:04:43 {Aoba}        Incoming signal! 
01:04:44 {Aoba}        Activation of a new type of Eva confirmed.
01:05:06 {Shinji}      We're not alone.
01:05:08 {Kaworu}      You mean the Mark.09? 
01:05:08 {Kaworu}      It's here as our backup.
01:05:12 {Kaworu}      It will warn us of any Wille activity.
01:05:15 {Shinji}      The two of us should be enough for all that.
01:05:18 {Shinji}      She isn't even Ayanami...
01:05:22 {Rei}         Not... Ayanami?
01:05:28 {Shinji}      The walls...?
01:05:30 {Kaworu}      Yes, all of the failures of infinity.
01:05:38 {Kaworu}      Don't let them weigh upon your mind.
01:05:42 {Kaworu}      We're nearly at Lilith's barrier.
01:05:45 {Kaworu}      The Main Shaft is completely blocked,
01:05:47 {Kaworu}      keeping anyone from intruding over the past fourteen years.
01:05:56 {Shinji}      It's like one big lid.
01:06:00 {Kaworu}      It's all right. Eva-13 was made for breaking through this.
01:06:03 {Kaworu}      The two of us can do it.
01:06:15 {Kaworu}      Try to join tempos. 
01:06:17 {Kaworu}      Remember the piano duet.
01:06:24 {Kaworu}      Let's go, Shinji-kun.
01:06:48 {Shinji}      We did it!
01:07:07 {Kaworu}      We've arrived. The deepest part of Central Dogma.
01:07:14 {Kaworu}      The epicenter of Third Impact.
01:07:21 {Shinji}      Is this Lilith?
01:07:23 {Kaworu}      It once was. 
01:07:25 {Kaworu}      Now, it is her corpse.
01:07:27 {Shinji}      Misato-san, even though we tried to protect it with our lives...
01:07:32 {Shinji}      Uh... That's an Eva?
01:07:35 {Kaworu}      Yes, the Eva Mark.06.
01:07:38 {Kaworu}      Remodeled into an autonomous type, 
01:07:40 {Kaworu}      exploitation by the Lilin brought the unit to a state of ruin.
01:07:48 {Shinji}      The things that are piercing them... are our targets?
01:07:52 {Kaworu}      Yes, the Spears of Longinus and Cassius. Wielding both requires two souls.
01:08:00 {Kaworu}      That is why we have the Double Entry System.
01:08:04 {Shinji}      Then... wouldn't THAT pilot have been just as good for this as me?
01:08:08 {Kaworu}      No, a Lilin imitation cannot be used.
01:08:10 {Kaworu}      Their souls' placement is different.
01:08:14 {Kaworu}      Well, let's begin.
01:08:23 {Kaworu}      Hold on. 
01:08:25 {Kaworu}      Something is wrong.
01:08:26 {Shinji}      What is it, Kaworu-kun?
01:08:31 {Kaworu}      This is not right... 
01:08:32 {Kaworu}      Both of the Spears have changed to a similar shape.
01:08:36 {Shinji}      Let's just pull the Spears quickly!
01:08:38 {Shinji}      That's why we came here in this Eva.
01:08:44 {Shinji}      What's going on?!
01:08:55 {Shinji}      Eva-02?
01:08:57 {Shinji}      Asuka!
01:09:00 {Shinji}      What are you doing, Asuka?!
01:09:05 {Asuka}       Stupid Shinji?!
01:09:06 {Asuka}       You can't seriously be piloting an Eva?
01:09:08 {Shinji}      I am. 
01:09:10 {Shinji}      I'm going to change the world with this Eva!
01:09:13 {Asuka}       You little brat...
01:09:15 {Asuka}       If that's how it is, don't pilot!
01:09:25 {Asuka}       Support fire, you're always late!
01:09:26 {Mari}        Sorry, sorry!
01:09:28 {Mari}        Adams' Vessel-san,
01:09:31 {Mari}        allow me to stop your plan, at least...
01:09:54 {Shinji}      Why are you interfering, Asuka?
01:09:56 {Shinji}      Those are our Spears of Hope!
01:10:01 {Asuka}       Stop!... looking!... for trouble!
01:10:04 {Asuka}       You brat, Shinji!
01:10:05 {Asuka}       Are you planning to start Third Impact again?
01:10:07 {Shinji}      You're wrong! 
01:10:09 {Shinji}      I'm trying to fix everything!
01:10:12 {Shinji}      I'm trying to save the world!
01:10:16 {Asuka}       You really are a little twerp.
01:10:19 {Shinji}      You just don't get it!
01:10:30 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun, why aren't you helping?
01:10:34 {Kaworu}      Cassius and Longinus. Both of the Spears are needed...
01:10:39 {Kaworu}      But the only two Spears that are here are the same...
01:10:43 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!
01:10:44 {Kaworu}      That's it! 
01:10:46 {Kaworu}      Now I understand,
01:10:48 {Kaworu}      Lilin!
01:10:55 {Mari}        Hey, Seele temp pilot,
01:10:58 {Mari}        you can hear me, right?
01:11:00 {Mari}        Don't you think you should get out before you turn into an Adams' Vessel?
01:11:04 {Rei}         No. That is not the order I received.
01:11:07 {Mari}        Talk about a square.
01:11:09 {Mari}        You know your original was a whole lot more friendly?
01:11:12 {Rei}         Original?
01:11:14 {Rei}         The other me...
01:11:30 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun? What's the matter?
01:11:45 {Shinji}      Asuka... 
01:11:46 {Shinji}      Please! Stay out of our way!
01:11:49 {Asuka}       Go down quietly, you little brat!
01:11:57 {Asuka}       Of all times! 
01:11:58 {Asuka}       Hey, Glasses! I need a spare!
01:12:07 {Shinji}      While we still have the chance! The Spears!
01:12:11 {Asuka}       You'd raise a hand against a girl... 
01:12:13 {Asuka}       You're the worst.
01:12:14 {Mari}        Spare, incoming!
01:12:28 {Kaworu}      Let's stop, Shinji. 
01:12:30 {Kaworu}      I have a bad feeling about this...
01:12:32 {Shinji}      Kaworu, we can't! 
01:12:34 {Shinji}      We came here to do something!
01:12:37 {Kaworu}      We've done enough!
01:12:38 {Kaworu}      These aren't the Spears we came for!
01:12:41 {Shinji}      Not... the Spears we came for?
01:12:47 {Shinji}      You're the one who said we need the Spears.
01:12:50 {Shinji}      That's why I got into this Eva!
01:12:57 {Kaworu}      The control system...?
01:13:02 {Shinji}      For Kaworu...
01:13:05 {Shinji}      for everyone, I will get the Spears!
01:13:07 {Shinji}      Only then will the world go back to how it should be.
01:13:11 {Shinji}      If I do that, even Misato-san will...
01:13:15 {Asuka}       Damn!
01:13:16 {Asuka}       Glasses! Get rid of the barrier!
01:13:18 {Asuka}       You're cleared to use AA ammo!
01:13:20 {Mari}        I've been waiting for this.
01:13:22 {Mari}        Check these babies out!
01:13:30 {Mari}        No A.T. Field?
01:13:32 {Mari}        Don't tell me this unit...
01:13:46 {Kaworu}      Don't do it, Shinji-kun!
01:13:48 {Asuka}       Stop, you stupid brat!
01:14:13 {Gendo}       Let's begin, Fuyutsuki.
01:14:22 {Shinji}      Eva Mark-06?
01:14:25 {Shinji}      Pattern blue? 
01:14:26 {Shinji}      What's going on?
01:14:30 {Asuka}       This is bad! 
01:14:32 {Asuka}       The Twelfth Angel is still alive!
01:14:35 {Asuka}       Glasses, Container No.3!
01:14:37 {Mari}        Got it!
01:14:40 {Asuka}       I'll deal with this before Third Impact starts up again!
01:14:49 {Rei}         It was on orders.
01:15:00 {Shinji}      An Angel!?
01:15:10 {Mari}        Princess, you should cease the futile fire. 
01:15:14 {Mari}        The whole thing is a core.
01:15:17 {Mari}        With just us, it's impossible to hurt that thing.
01:15:21 {Mari}        Besides that, by defeating the Last Angel,
01:15:24 {Mari}        we don't know what kind of evil will come out.
01:15:26 {Mari}        You're worried, no?
01:15:32 {Rei}         This is...
01:15:37 {Rei}         This is... me?
01:15:41 {Rei}         What am I...?
01:15:46 {Shinji}      The controls aren't responding. 
01:15:47 {Shinji}      What's going on, Kaworu?
01:15:51 {Shinji}      Kaworu!
01:15:53 {Kaworu}      I never imagined that I, the First Angel,
01:15:56 {Kaworu}      would be cast down to the Thirteenth.
01:16:00 {Shinji}      What are you doing, Kaworu-kun?
01:16:04 {Kaworu}      So the beginning and the end are the same.
01:16:08 {Kaworu}      I'd expect as much from the King of the Lilim,
01:16:11 {Kaworu}      Shinji's father!
01:16:13 {Mari}        DSS Choker, pattern blue?
01:16:15 {Mari}        Thirteenth? The Twelfth should've been the last one!
01:16:19 {Mari}        So this is what Gendo is aiming for.
01:16:24 {Gendo}       It is time to amend the Dead Sea Scrolls' contract.
01:16:29 {Gendo}       This is farewell.
01:16:33 {Gendo}       Even though all of you have changed the shape of your souls,
01:16:37 {Gendo}       You are still lifeforms blessed with the Fruit of Knowledge.
01:16:41 {Gendo}       You are able to live for eternity,
01:16:44 {Gendo}       But, same as us, you still cannot escape the fate of death.
01:16:50 {Gendo}       To advance the evolution of the flock burdened with death,
01:16:54 {Gendo}       You had bestowed upon us the gift of civilization.
01:17:00 {Gendo}       As the representative of humanity, I say thank you.
01:17:04 {Gendo}       Through death, I shall return your souls to where they belong.
01:17:12 {Gendo}       The long desired Human Instrumentality Project,
01:17:15 {Gendo}       and the contracted deicide, will be completed by me.
01:17:19 {Gendo}       Rest assured.
01:17:21 {Keel}        Our wishes have come to fruition. 
01:17:25 {Keel}        Good.
01:17:26 {Keel}        Everything is good. 
01:17:29 {Keel}        Human Instrumentality.
01:17:31 {Keel}        We hope for the peaceful purification of all souls.
01:18:06 {Asuka}       Damn it! 
01:18:07 {Asuka}       It's entering its pseudo-evolved form!
01:18:09 {Mari}        Guess it's Awakening...
01:18:12 {Mari}        It's one of the surviving Adams!
01:18:49 {Shinji}      What's this...?
01:19:04 {Shinji}      What IS this...?
01:19:11 {Shinji}      It's all my fault!
01:19:14 {Shinji}      Because I pulled the Spears!
01:19:22 {Shinji}      This is...!
01:19:24 {Kaworu}      Fourth Impact...
01:19:28 {Kaworu}      These are the opening ceremonies.
01:19:45 {Shinji}      Kaworu... 
01:19:46 {Shinji}      The choker!
01:19:55 {Shinji}      Misato?!
01:19:59 {Misato}      A.T. Field at maximum!
01:20:01 {Misato}      Contain the Eva in its present state!
01:20:03 {Misato}      / Main gun shot done! Reloading this revolver! {主砲斉射用意！極射弾装填！}
01:20:06 {Misato}      Do whatever it takes to keep Fourth Impact in check!
01:20:08 {Misato}      Fire!
01:20:17 {Midori}      Damage received! Direct hit to main armament!
01:20:19 {Misato}      The Adams' Vessel?!
01:20:26 {Tama}        Shots received on midsection! Damage unknown!
01:20:28 {Woman (BG)} / The target is the new-type Eva! ＃＃＃＃
01:20:30 {Sumire}      Rudder is ineffective!
01:20:32 {Sumire}      We're losing altitude!
01:20:43 {Tama}        / 中＃＃＃＃＃＃！
01:20:46 {Ritsuko}     The Adams' Vessel... Wunder's original master!
01:20:48 {Ritsuko}     It intends to take the ship's controls back from Eva-01!
01:20:57 {Rei}         Why can't I restore the link?
01:21:05 {Mari}        Oh, man! 
01:21:07 {Mari}        These guys are not messing around.
01:21:10 {Asuka}       Glasses, you handle the brat's Eva!
01:21:12 {Asuka}       I'll help out Wunder with 02'!
01:21:14 {Mari}        Roger!
01:21:15 {Midori}      Unable to reject the Adams' Vessel!
01:21:17 {Tama}        Unidentified data is infiltrating the main control system!
01:21:19 {Aoba}        It is hijacking control of the ship!
01:21:43 {Asuka}       / ＃＃＃！？ That's Seele's style, all right!
01:21:53 {Asuka}       Mode change!
01:21:55 {Asuka}       Code 777 (Triple Seven)!
01:22:04 {Rei}         Who's there?
01:22:05 {Asuka}       Who the hell are YOU?!
01:22:24 {Aoba}        Report from lower bridge. 
01:22:26 {Aoba}        Eva-02' has engaged the Adams' Vessel!
01:22:27 {Misato}      We're counting on you, Asuka.
01:22:48 {Rei}         If I were Ayanami Rei, what would I do at a time like this?
01:22:51 {Asuka}       Hell if I know!
01:22:58 {Asuka}       Do whatever you want!
01:23:09 {Asuka}       Geez! The whole thing's a core?
01:23:12 {Asuka}       No time...
01:23:14 {Asuka}       Sorry, Eva-02!
01:23:31 {Sumire}      Control systems restored!
01:23:33 {Misato}      Emergency launch of all ships! 
01:23:34 {Misato}      Pursue the target Eva immediately!
01:23:36 {Ritsuko}     Captain, it won't be possible until the main unit is restored!
01:23:40 {Misato}      Shinji-kun...
01:24:02 {Shinji}      This is all because of me...
01:24:06 {Shinji}      I...
01:24:12 {Kaworu}      It's not your fault.
01:24:15 {Kaworu}      It's because I became the Thirteenth Angel.
01:24:19 {Kaworu}      I'm the trigger.
01:24:21 {Shinji}      What am I suppose to do?
01:24:24 {Shinji}      Tell me what am I suppose to do?
01:24:31 {Shinji}      Kaworu,
01:24:34 {Shinji}      tell me what the right thing would be.
01:24:37 {Kaworu}      Even if souls disappear, hopes and curses will remain in this world.
01:24:43 {Kaworu}      Intent is imparted to the world as information and goes on to change.
01:24:48 {Kaworu}      In time, even one's very self is being rewritten.
01:24:54 {Kaworu}      I'm sorry. This isn't the happiness you wished for.
01:24:59 {Kaworu}      I will close the Door of Guf.
01:25:03 {Kaworu}      You don't need to worry about it, Shinji.
01:25:05 {Shinji}      Kaworu...
01:25:08 {Shinji}      What are you saying, Kaworu?
01:25:11 {Shinji}      I don't get any of it!
01:25:18 {Kaworu}      Shinji, you should find a place of peace and self.
01:25:31 {Kaworu}      Fate will surely guide you.
01:25:37 {Kaworu}      Don't make that face.
01:25:41 {Kaworu}      We'll meet again, Shinji.
01:25:44 {Shinji}      Kaworu!
01:26:04 {Mari}        The Door of Guf hasn't closed yet?
01:26:06 {Mari}        So, Puppy Boy is Seele's backup measure!
01:26:25 {Mari}        I'm done cleaning up! 
01:26:26 {Mari}        Hang in there, Puppy Boy!
01:26:30 {Mari}        Don't be such a baby! 
01:26:31 {Mari}        Help out the Princess, at least! 
01:26:33 {Mari}        Be a man! 
01:26:36 {Mari}        And while you're at it, get to know the world a little!
01:27:33 {Fuyutsuki}   What dreadful circumstances. 
01:27:35 {Fuyutsuki}    Most of it is according to Seele's plans.
01:27:38 {Gendo}       But the removal of Seele's boy also led to Eva-13's Awakening.
01:27:46 {Gendo}       Captain Katsuragi's actions are within predictions, as well.
01:27:49 {Gendo}             This will do for now.

01:28:07 {Ritsuko}     Misato, let's leave it for now...
01:29:01 {Asuka}       Shinji, you idiot.
01:29:04 {Asuka}       You didn't come to help me?
01:29:10 {Asuka}       Once again, it's all about you.
01:29:12 {Asuka}       You think you can just get away with what's happened by not saying a thing.
01:29:40 {Asuka}       You still need pampering?
01:29:43 {Asuka}       You're always such a time-wasting brat.
01:29:47 {Asuka}       Here, put this on.
01:29:50 {Asuka}       Jeez! You can stand on your own, can't you?!
01:29:58 {Asuka}       The pilot from earlier.
01:30:02 {Asuka}       From an early lot of Ayanami Types?
01:30:11 {Asuka}       The L Barrier's density is too strong here, so they won't come to help us.
01:30:16 {Asuka}       We're going to where the Lilim are.
01:30:23 {Asuka}       Come on!
